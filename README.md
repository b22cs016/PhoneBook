I have used concepts of data structures , oops , file handling to create a template to implement a PhoneBook. PhoneBook is implemented in interface_template.cpp . Few testcases have been uploaded as well to check the working of the code . This is one of the projects given in Data Structures & Algorithms Course . PhoneBook is implemented through hashing with collision resolved using chaining scheme . The prohttps://gist.github.com/Pranavchiku/7065b091d66e4431b683684aebc4e10eblem statement is given here
